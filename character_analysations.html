            <center><h1>1. Shaun "Growls" Thompson [main character of the novel]</h1> <br></center>
            <h2>Growls is introduced as the teenage main character of the novel. The majority of his personality consists of humor,
            awkwardness and clumsiness [definition=ungeschicklichkeit / schlaksigkeit]. <br> <br>
            He is into rap and hip hop culture, which is shown by his attitude and interests like becoming a rapper.
            He is also very close with his best friend Shanks, who is introduced in the first chapter of the novel. Growls openly expresses some of his feelings and thoughts, but he hides some of them behind rap lines, which he recites to the people around him.
            This shows Growls passion for rap and hip hop culture, as well as his awkwardness which is shown by the way he expresses himself. the way he casually talks [see language analysis] and his body language further expand the way how he delivers his jokes and humorously tells the audience the plot of each chapter.
            on the other hand, Growls clumsiness and awkwardness lead to the main jokes of the novel. His actions constantly lure him into embarrassing situations and awkward moments. <br> <br>
            Overall, Growls is a very fitting and not so serious character for the main plot and humor of the teen novel.<br> <br> <br> </h2>
            
            <center><h1>2. Shanks [first appearance in Chapter 1 page 1/2]</h1> <br></center>
            <h2>Shanks is introduced as the best friend of the main character Growls. He shares similar personality traits and even follows some of the same interests as Growls. <br> <br>
            Shanks spends alot of time with the main character and likes to rap with him. Growls states that Shanks is not as good as him in rapping, but a smart guy [chapter 1 page 2]
            The reason why he is such a close friend to Growls is because of their mutual helpfulness and time spent together. 
            Shanks follows Growls in alot of situations [including Growls date in Chapter 3 page 1] and happens to find himself in the same embarrassing situations like Growls does. <br> <br>
            Overall, Shanks is an awkward, but true friend who adds the same type of humor to the novel as the main characters'.</h2> <br> <br>
