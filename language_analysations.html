            <h2>The language in the teen novel "Steady For This" by Nathaniel Lessore largely contains casual, metaphoric and slangy phrases. [the following examples are from chapter 2 page 1] <br> <br>
            During PE lesson, the main character [nicknamed "Growls"] excercises and uses the time to chat with Shanks, his best friend. 
            First, the scenery of the chapter is described in detail, which is then followed by Growls mood, the tone of the chapter and the position of the characters.
            For example, it is stated that Growls is "sweating like a Krispy Kreme" [Krispy Kreme is an american company which produces donuts glazed in sugar].
            This phrase is a metaphor which represents the way how Growl sweats from  PE. In this way, the author lets the audience relate to the characters interpretation
            of excessively sweating during excercising. <br> <br>
            The tone is relaxed and the mood is neutral. Shanks asks Growls alot of questions, to which Growls thinks to himself that "Shanks is grilling me like a baked potato".
            This is another metaphor which is used to describe the way how Shanks asks Growls many questions. The author uses this phrase to show that Growls is overwhelmed by the questions and starts to joke about it. <br> <br>
            Overall, the language is casual/slangy and the author uses many metaphors to describe the characters mood and tone. The use of slangy phrases such as "grilling me like a baked potato" and "sweating like a Krispy Kreme" makes the text more relatable to the audience, especially to teenagers who use a similar language in their everyday life. <br> <br> </h2>
